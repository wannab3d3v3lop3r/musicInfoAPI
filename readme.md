The goal of this project is the ability to see which EDM artist is playing in a particular area
and be able to listen to its top songs.

Most sites have it where they are able to show where EDM artists playing but doesn't have a way to listen 
to the artist's music at the site. I've made it where its possible to listen to it without having to search. 
After a few clicks, it will direct you to the song on Youtube's page.

Uses EDMTrain, Spotify, and Youtube API.
