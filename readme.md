The goal of this project is the ability to see which EDM artist is playing in a particular area
and be able to listen to its top songs.

Most sites have it where they are able to show where EDM artists playing but doesn't have a way to listen 
to the artist's music at the site. I've made it where its possible to listen to it without having to search. 
After a few clicks, it will direct you to the song on Youtube's page.

Uses EDMTrain, Spotify, and Youtube API.

//USER EXPERIENCE

Users will be able to select certain cities within a state.
They will be able to see which EDM artist will be playing on a particular date.
Once they click on the artist, their top songs will populate.
After clicking on a song, a Youtube video link will show and direct you to the page once clicked.
